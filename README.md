# Mission-to-Mars

In this project, we helped our friend Robin build a web app to scrape live data, from the NASA Mars News site, each type we run the script. We were able to achieve this by using HTML with BeautifulSoup and Splinter. In the end of the project, the goal was to scrape four full-resolution Mars hemisphere images and titles from the site to update the web app.
